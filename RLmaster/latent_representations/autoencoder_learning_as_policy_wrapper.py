    """
    AutoencoderLatentSpace is the autoencoder which learns on image
    reconstruction loss alongside a reinforcement learning policy (any rl alg really).
    Its purpose is to provide a lower dimensional embedding 
    for the reinforcement learning alg.
    It inherits from BasePolicy because that is the most convenient way
    to set up learning within tianshou.
    Furthermore, it takes the reinforcement learning policy as an argument 
    and acts as a wrapper around it (as it should, given that its purpose is to
    stand between the agent and environment).
    This makes parallel learning not only convenient, but also, ideally, 
    enables switching between different reinforcement learning algorithms
    as simple as passing a different parameter (as it should be, given that
    it should act as an independent wrapper).


    :param BasePolicy policy: a base policy to add AutoencoderLatentSpace to.
    :param CNNEncoderNew encoder: the encoder part of the autoencoder.
    :param CNNDecoderNew decoder: the encoder part of the autoencoder.
    :param torch.optim.Optimizer optim_encoder: a torch.optim for optimizing the encoder.
    :param torch.optim.Optimizer optim_decoder: a torch.optim for optimizing the decoder.
    :param float lr_scale: the scaling factor for autoencoder learning.
    :param float forward_loss_weight: the weight for forward model loss.
