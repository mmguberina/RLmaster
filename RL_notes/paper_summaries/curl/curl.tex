\subsection{Abstract}
CURL extracts high-level features from raw pixels by using contrastive learning
and performs off-policy control on top of the extracted features.
It works well.


\subsection{Introduction}
To make image-based RL more efficient, people tried:
\begin{enumerate}
		\item do auxiliary tasks on observations
		\item learn world models that predict the future
\end{enumerate}
CuRL is in the first camp of methods.
