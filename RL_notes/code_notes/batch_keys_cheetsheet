1. obs
------
- should be actual obs you get from the environment (after env wrappers ofc), 
  BUT then tianshou code would need to be changed because obs key is assumed everywhere,
  and that's more annoying than dealing with the confusion.
- THUS this key will be use for the EMBEDDED observations

2. obs_orig
-----------
- the original obs you get from env.step

3. act 
------
- outputs from the policy are processed (ex. argmax is done on outputs which are action scores) 
  and then they get put here 

4. rew 
------
- no necessary changes needed

5. done
-------
- no necessary changes needed

6. obs_next
-----------
- want this to be embedded obs like above
- need to see how this is set up 

? obs_next_orig
---------------
- implement if necessary

7. info 
-------
- no necessary changes needed

8. policy 
---------
- for hidden states and stuff, we don't use this 
--> it's perma None
